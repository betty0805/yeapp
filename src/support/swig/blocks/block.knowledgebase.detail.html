What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?.</h4>

We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>

Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>

Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</p>
                <p class="text-lg">I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>

You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</p>
